## What is this?

This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. 

The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it or even provide feedback on it! 

Please treat this document as both a reference and a promise on how I will to conduct myself as a manager, and what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your input, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

## My Role

I am here to make sure our team is successful, working on the next-most-important-thing™, and to help create a space where you can do the <u>best work of your life</u>. 

More specifically:

- I am here to make sure our team is successful and pointed in the right direction. 
- I am here to help you improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy the work, and align yourself to our company's mission.
- I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us.

 I also write code, and am the primary architect of our systems, tooling, and platforms.

## Feedback

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:

- Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be high)
- Effort (the amount of work in order to give feedback; should be low)
- Benefit (likelihood of giving you feedback will impact your behavior; should be high)

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions. I'll let you know if you don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

While I care about kindness, I tend to optimize for effectiveness when giving feedback -- and within that optimized effectiveness try to be as kind as possible.

## One on Ones

Regular 1:1 meetings are extremely important. The cadence, length, etc. is totally up for discussion though. These meetings are designed to give you a dedicated time and place to ask anything and everything.

Hopefully, we talk about things you wouldn’t otherwise bring up in a group setting. I want our 1:1 to be a safe place; if this isn’t the case please tell my boss.

We will go through your agenda first and if time permits I will always have some questions. First and foremost these meetings are for you.

Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1. Just pull me aside and we can talk.

## Career Development

Your career is yours to manage. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I am always available to provide feedback on your trajectory and will make suggestions on things you can do both inside and outside of the office that will allow you to grow personally and professionally.

I will try to push projects and tasks your way that align with your career goals, but It will be up to to you to seize these growth and learning opportunities and run with them.

At the end of the day, it is your career. Set your goal and let me know how I can help you achieve them.

##  Leadership Style

In general, I am pretty hands off as a manager. As long as I feel that you are on task, and on target, I will try to let you get in the zone and work with as few distractions as possible. I will only follow up on assigned tasks if I haven't gotten an update from you recently. 

While I won't try to interrupt you, you can ALWAYS interrupt me. I am very good at context switching, and may only ask for 10 or 15 mins to finish my current train of thought before I am able to give you my undivided attention.

I tend to push lots of information out, usually over chat or on github, and tend to think everyone is doing the same. I expect my team to own the work the they take on, and to see it through to production and beyond. This includes communicating regularly about the changes they want to make and are making to our code and documentation.

I am a big believer in “[no broken windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)” when building products: I like clean logs, clean exceptions, clean codebases, and elegant abstractions. If you see something that needs fixing, fix it.

I never want to be a blocker to what you're working on. If you need me to chime in on something, hit me up on slack (if you just want a quick answer) or put time on my calendar.  If I am unavailable, do what you think is best. Just try to fit your solution into the existing patterns and architecture of the patlform so far. I wouldn't have hired you if I didn't trust you.

## Personality Quirks

- I argue with “passion” - I may raise my voice a little and may come off as dismissive. I don’t like this about myself, and try catch myself when I am doing it. When you feel I crossed the line, tell me.
- I have strong opinions, weakly held.  I love to debate and see an issue from all sides.  Question everything, and we’ll all be better for it.
- I care about my words and endeavor to choose them carefully.  I take this too far sometimes, and forget that not everyone shares my connotations.
